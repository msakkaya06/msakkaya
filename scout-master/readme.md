*Scout* is an open-source custom quadcopter flight controller firmware that I developed from absolute scratch. The *Scout Flight Controller* is written in MicroPython and runs on a $4 Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Development Tutorial
I'm publicly sharing all that I learned during the three months I spent dreaming about and developing *Scout*. I wrote a 12-chapter series on how I developed *Scout* and the hardware requirements. You can find the articles on Medium below:

## Repository Contents
- The complete source code can be found in [the `src` folder](./src/).
- "Bonus code" snippets (code that isn't immediately required by the flight controller software but can be of help for specific tasks anyway) can be found [in the `bonus_code` folder](./bonus_code/).

## Using this Code
[I am releasing *Scout's* full source code under the MIT License](license.md). I hope this code can be of use for learning purposes, testing, personal projects, or any other benevolent reason. I do not condone the use of this software for malevolent reasons and do not take responsibility for any direct or indirect consequences. Please explore the skies responsibly.
